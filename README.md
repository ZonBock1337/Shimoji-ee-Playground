**Shimoji-ee Playground** was made for "Neurolings", Shimoji was created for a better experience with "Neurolings" (also Shimeji),<br>
with Shimoji you can create a Playground, if they thow the Playground away, the Playground will come back (with a smooth animation) to the center.

**MAINFUNCTION OF SHIMOJI:**<br>
If a cheeky Shimoji tries to throw the window away, it will be reset to the middle afterwards (provided it is no longer in the monitor's field of view). ([see here](https://github.com/ZonBock1337/Shimoji-ee-Playground/blob/master/README.md#previews))
<br><br>
You also can use your own Playground (playground folder) for Shimoji Playground just go in the editor and change it!

You now can select Playgrounds not just a image, you can add a custom icon and overlays, it's just a folder, that means it is super easy!

In some places, I didn't write particularly good code,<br>
there were days when I wasn't feeling well.<br>
I will fix the errors in future updates.

This App was made for "Neurolings" but you can use it for other Shimeji's if you want!
I hope you like this project!
