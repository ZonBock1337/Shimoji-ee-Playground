**What is Shimoji-ee Playground?**

**MAINFUNCTION OF SHIMOJI:** If a cheeky Shimoji tries to throw the window away, it will be reset to the middle afterwards (provided it is no longer in the monitor's field of view). ([see here](https://github.com/ZonBock1337/Shimoji-ee-Playground/blob/master/README.md#previews))
<br><br>
You also can use your own Playground (playground folder) for Shimoji Playground just go in the editor and change it!

# Neurolings

For **Shimoji-ee Playground** you will need [Neurolings](https://x.com/Monikaphobia/status/1844272129619132682?s=20), you dont need it really but this App was made for [it](https://x.com/Monikaphobia/status/1844272129619132682?s=20)<br>

**Requirements**<br>
You need **Java 11** for [Neurolings](https://x.com/Monikaphobia/status/1844272129619132682?s=20)

# Shimeji

**Shimoji-ee Playground** works also fine with [Shimeji](https://kilkakon.com/shimeji/)<br>

**Requirements**<br>
For [Shimeji](https://kilkakon.com/shimeji/) you will need **Java 8**

# Linux Support
Shimoji-ee Playground will **not** support linux, the reason for this is because [Shimeji](https://kilkakon.com/shimeji/) doesn't support linux (also Neurolings)
