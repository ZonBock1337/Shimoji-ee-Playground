**What is Shimoji Playground?**

Shimoji Playground is an app that lets you make your Shimojis climb up a window (the standard Shimoji function).  
**BUT:** If a cheeky Shimoji tries to throw the window away, it will be reset to the middle afterwards (provided it is no longer in the monitor's field of view).
