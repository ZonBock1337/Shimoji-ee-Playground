**What is Shimoji-ee Playground?**

Shimoji-ee Playground is an app that lets you make your Shimeji's climb up a window (the standard Shimeji function).  
**BUT:** If a cheeky Shimoji tries to throw the window away, it will be reset to the middle afterwards (provided it is no longer in the monitor's field of view). ([see here](https://github.com/ZonBock1337/Shimoji-ee-Playground/blob/master/README.md#previews))
<br>
You also can use your own Playground (Image) for Shimoji Playground just go in the editor and change it!

After the official first 1.0.0 release, i will make a Playground Builder (also in the app like the editor), i hope so.<br>
The format will be (.spb)

# Requirements
For **Shimoji-ee Playground** you will need [Shimeji](https://kilkakon.com/shimeji/), you dont need it really but this App was made for [Shimeji](https://kilkakon.com/shimeji/).<br>
Also you need **Java 11** for [Shimeji](https://kilkakon.com/shimeji/)

# Linux Support
Shimoji-ee Playground will **not** support linux, the reason for this is because [Shimeji](https://kilkakon.com/shimeji/) doesn't support linux (simple reason)
