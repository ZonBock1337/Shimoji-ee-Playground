**What is Shimoji Playground?**

Shimoji Playground is an app that lets you make your Shimojis climb up a window (the standard Shimoji function).  
**BUT:** If a cheeky Shimoji tries to throw the window away, it will be reset to the middle afterwards (provided it is no longer in the monitor's field of view).  
<br>
You also can use your own Playground (Image) for Shimoji Playground just go in the editor and change it!

After the official first 1.0.0 release, i will make a Playground Builder (also in the app like the editor), i hope so.<br>
The format will be (.spb)

Also you need **Java 11** for [Shimeji](https://kilkakon.com/shimeji/)
